# OSCCord
Very simple little program for VRChat OSC, it takes the messages from a Discord Server (or servers) and outputs them to your chatbox.

### 2. Setup and run the program

Download the latest release of OSCCord [here](https://github.com/Morg-S9/aq-visualizer/releases), or  and extract it somewhere where it won't get tangled in with all your other files.

Launch VRChat before running OSCCord.

With VRChat open, run OSCCord. It will prompt you for your Discord Token. Copy your token again if you need to, paste it into the console window, then press Enter. 

Your bot should now be online and working!
